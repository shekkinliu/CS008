            <p class="bold border">Midnight Delivery is a business founded by two Computer Science majors studying in the University of Vermont, Ken Liu and Rohit Nawani. We both share a burning passion in Computer Science and food. Being constantly disappointed and defeated by the food options and prices on campus, we have decided to lead a revolution. We are aiming to bring a massive variety of food options on campus, including Ben and Jerry’s, quality ready-meal, crackers, exotic snacks imported from foreign countries, etc.

            <p>Hi! Being a half-HongKongese and half-Indian brought up in Hong Kong who then studied abroad in England for 6 years, my life experience has been a blessing so far. Food, NBA and football (apparently known as “soccer” in America) and the Weeknd sums up my life. I do all kinds of food, except the obvious <acronym title="Ginger, Olives and Pickles">GOP </acronym>. Any kind of spicy food puts a smile on my face, especially Chinese Sichuan cuisine.

            <p>Hey, what’s up? I am Ken, I am a HongKongese who moved into the United States 6 years ago with my parents. My life has changed throughout this transition from an urban environment to a suburban environment, learning English was kind of hard in the beginning, but I guess I did alright after making a few friends here. Whenever I have free time, I would play badminton and explore the art of photography. I am a big napping addict, who doesn’t like naps? I personally think that napping can help you to concentrate in work, especially when you have a huge workload, you don’t want to sacrifice too much sleep, right? For food preference, I am also an anti-GOP type of guy, my favorite food would be any kinds of desserts.</p>
