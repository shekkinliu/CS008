            <p class="bold border">Midnight Delivery is a business founded by two Computer Science majors studying in the University of Vermont, Ken Liu and Rohit Nawani. We both share a burning passion in Computer Science and food. Being constantly disappointed and defeated by the food options and prices on campus, we have decided to lead a revolution. We are aiming to bring a massive variety of food options on campus, including Ben and Jerry’s, quality ready-meal, crackers, exotic snacks imported from foreign countries, etc.

            <p>Hi! Being a half-HongKongese and half-Indian brought up in Hong Kong who then studied abroad in England for 6 years, my life experience has been a blessing so far. Food, NBA and football (apparently known as “soccer” in America) and the Weeknd sums up my life. I do all kinds of food, except the obvious GOP (pickles, olives and ginger). Any kind of spicy food puts a smile on my face, especially Chinese Sichuan cuisine.
