                <p>“Would you like a smile with your General Tsao chicken with rice? That would be extra 10%. Thanks ”</p>
                <p>-->MD strongly rejects the idea of tipping and we are promoting a non-tipping culture due to the following reasons:</p>
                <ol>
                    <li>Strong correlation with tipping and sexual harassment</li>
                    <li>Tipping system tips the scale of power heavily towards the customers and we believe that customers and staffs should be both held at an equal balance of power. </li>
                    <li>Tipping creates an extra layer of superficiality within our society. </li>
                    <li>Staffs should not only serve well with the main purpose of earning more tips but with genuine hospitality that comes from the bottom of their hearts. </li>

                </ol>
